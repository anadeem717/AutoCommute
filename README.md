# AutoCommute

This Python script utilizes the Google Maps API and Twilio REST API to send you commute distance and duration from your home to your school via text message. It's a handy tool in the morning so you know when to leave!

## Prerequisites

Before you can use this script, you'll need to set up a few things:

1. **Google Maps API Key:** You should have a valid Google Maps API Key, which you can obtain from the [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/). Save this API Key in a text file named `GoogleMapsAPI.txt` in the same directory as this script.

2. **Twilio Account:** Create a Twilio account if you don't have one already. You'll need your Twilio Account SID and Auth Token, which you can find in your [Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/console).

3. **Twilio Phone Number:** Get a Twilio phone number from the [Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers).
