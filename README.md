# AutoCommute

This Python program utilizes the Google Maps API and Twilio REST API to send you commute distance and duration from your home to your school via text message. It's a handy tool in the morning so you know when to leave!

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the program, you'll need to set up a few things:

1. **Google Maps API Key:** You need to have a valid Google Maps API Key, which you can get from [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/). Save this API Key in a text file named `GoogleMapsAPI.txt` in the same directory as `main.py`.

2. **Twilio Account:** Create a Twilio account if you don't already have one. You'll need your Twilio Account SID, Auth Token, and phone number to paste into the program.

3. To automate this at a specific time/day, you can run this on a task scheduler on a computer.
